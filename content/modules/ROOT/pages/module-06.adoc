= Visualizing the Scenario

We have seen how we can lay our the necessary infrastructure and devices to start building a smart city, and we have been able to define and connect up smart devices in a smart city platform.

== Your Smart City

During the course of this workshop, you built the necessary components for a smart city digital infrastructure platform. Use this opportunity to take a look at the platform we built.

To do this, we will head back to the {openshift_console_url}. Once there, head to the image:visualizing-developer-perspective-button.png[] and then select the topology button.

And you should still have your web application from a previous lab available, which should look like:

If you closed the previous browser window/tab with this, you can return to it from the topology view by selecting

You may have noticed during the course of building the platform, we had some components that we did not use or discuss -- primarily the `SUMO` component in this topology here.

You may have also notice in our front end web application, a image:/smartvillage-simulation-report-button.png[button for the simulation environment]. Had you clicked on this button you would have been brought to a form to submit simulations for testing and experimentation:

.which is actually a fairly long form

Had you attempted to select the form, of course nothing would have happened.


== The shared smart city platform

Also during the course of this workshop, you added some IoT devices into an existing smart city digital infrastructure platform - the shared environment mentioned earlier in this lab. Use this opportunity to take a look at the platform we built. You can find this in the `smartvillage` project in the platform, and all users should have view access to this platform. It should look like the same platform you built.

Unfortunately in a constrained workshop environment like we have here, we were not able to exercise all the components and in particular we could not use the SUMO traffic simulation to inject live traffic and relied instead on the live feed from our demo connection to the NERC environment and its data.

.The SUMO traffic simulator

`SUMO` is an open source application that allows modeling of intermodal traffic systems including road vehicles, public transport and pedestrians. Included with SUMO is a wealth of supporting tools which handle tasks such as route finding, visualization, network import and emission calculation. SUMO can be enhanced with custom models and provides various APIs to remotely control the simulation. High quality simulations are important to be able to experiment with changes to city infrastructure or citizen technology, and a good simulator must handle scenarios including:

* Automated Driving: Integrate automated vehicles in your traffic simulations and equip your vehicles with a transition of control (ToC) device

* Vehicle Communication:  Implement and evaluate C2X communication technologies by coupling to a communication network simulator (OMNeT++ or ns-3)

* Traffic Management: Model video detectors and induction loops to manage traffic interactively by controlling speed limits, traffic lights and vehicle behavior

* Microscopic Simulation Simulate the movement of every individual object by modeling all vehicles, pedestrians and public transport explicitly

* Multimodal Traffic: Combine different modes of transportation and simulate cars, buses, trains, bicycles, pedestrians, public transport and more

* Online Interaction: Control the behavior of all simulation objects during a live simulation with the Traffic Control Interface (TraCI)

* Network Import: Import road networks from common network formats such as OpenStreetMap, VISUM, VISSIM, NavTeq, MATsim and OpenDRIVE

* Demand Generation: Use traffic counts on streets and junctions, origin-destination-matrices or virtual population models to generate realistic demand profiles

* Traffic Lights: Modify traffic light schedules visually with netedit, import schedules from external data sources or generate schedules automatically

* Performance, portability, Data models

As an open source solution, SUMO has also created rich community of providers of open source real and simulated data, such as link:https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/584669[this 24 hour simulated data set covering several cities] (including Red Hat's engineering home  in Boston MA)

.The "TAPAS Cologne" simulation scenario
image::/Tapas-cologne-simulation.png[The TAPAS Cologne simulation scenario with 24 hrs of data]

The "TAPAS Cologne" simulation scenario describes the traffic within the city of Cologne, Germany for a whole day. The original demand data stems from TAPAS, a system which computes mobility wishes for an area population generated based on information about travelling habits of Germans and on information about the infrastructure of the area they live in.

Veber√∂d smart villiage's platform does have a working instance of the `SUMO` simulator. Had we used this we would have been able to submit simulation reports:

.A simulation report
image::/visualizing-a-fully-deployed-smart-city-platform.png[a submitted simulation report]

We would have been able to collect the associated data and analysis in the smart village platform:

.The raw data

.Actionable insights from that raw data
image::/simulation-data-analysis.png[That raw data yeilds actionable insights from that raw data]

== A real smart city

Even though we were limited in the what we could do in the workshop format, fortunately  there is a thriving ecosystem of providers with components and specialized tools that solve specific challenges in the domains we noted earlier; traffic management and optimization is just one of many domains. Solutions that layer on top of and use the context broker architecture to exchange data is immense and covers smart lighting, energy management, emergency response, and many others.

Other providers and integrators like link:https://www.ui.city/en/[UI!] provide pre-built solutions already integrated and ready to deploy, built on these same technologies

What's next?

=== real data

Building the necessary physical and digital infrastructure in order to collect the live data and building the simulation and analytic capability to get the most value from that data.

=== real use cases

Focusing on the domain areas where you need to deliver the most value for your citizens, or meet regulatory needs, or provide avenues for funding and investment with solutions and delivery partners.
